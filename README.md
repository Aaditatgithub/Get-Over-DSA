# DSA Preparation
## Overview

This README documents my preparation in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) for coding interviews and competitive programming. It includes a structured collection of problems and concepts I've covered.

## Topics Covered
### Patterns
- Solved specific patterns beyond the very standard ones.

### Basic Maths
- Check Palindrome
- Count Digits
- Divisors
- GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)
- isPrime
- Reverse Number

### Basic Recursion
- Factorial
- Fibonacci
- Palindrome check
- Print numbers from 1 to N
- Reverse Array

### Arrays
#### Easy Problems
- Find largest element in an array
- Check if an array is monotonic
- Move zeros to the end of the array
- Remove duplicates from a sorted array
- Rotate an array
- Find the second largest element in an array

#### Medium Problems
- [List of medium array problems you have practiced]

#### Arrays
**1D Problems**
- Swap elements in an array
- Find pairs with a given sum
- Find triplets with a given sum
- Find a unique element in an array (where every other element occurs twice)

#### Tries
- Implement a Trie data structure
- Find the longest common prefix among a set of strings (using Trie)
- Implement a phone dictionary using Trie

#### Backtracking
- Solve Sudoku using backtracking
- Find a path in a maze (Rat in a Maze problem)
- Solve N-Queens problem using backtracking
